## Welcome to the **#matrix**

The objective of **#matrix** project is to offer a virtual environment office, as nice as physical offices. When we are working in a physical office is very common entering in discussion threads in many different environments, for example: on coffee, on lunch and others.

When we are working remotely there are no conversations like in a physical office. The **#matrix** project was born as a proposal to better that experience. The idea is to create a lot of virtual rooms where people can see and enter these rooms to participate.

**#matrix** produces a virtual office for remote teams. In this project, you can run a virtual office to simulate the physical environment. Read more on [this post in Medium](https://medium.com/rd-shipit/matrix-d4cfc4ad4c75).

## Understanding #matrix
### Rooms
The inside of **#matrix** there are some rooms. In this rooms is possible to see others colleagues and if they are talking or in a meeting in the avatar will appear a head set icon. (eg. In the image the guys in the Platform-Email room are in a meeting)  

|                              Office Page                               |                                     With Sidebar                                     |

### Availability And Meetings
**#matrix** is a virtual environment office, so you can show you are available for the other on enter in a room through the `ENTER ROOM` button. This is like "Hey, I am here in the office".
Or you can enter in a meeting through the button `ENTER MEETING`. 

The embeded meet is provided by [meet.jit.si](https://meet.jit.si) service and this service is maintained by the [Jitsi team](https://jitsi.org/the-community/#meet-our-team)
at [8x8](https://8x8.com). Access the [jitsi GitHub](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet#security) and learn more about this amazing video bridge service. You can change that using [external meet option](#External-Meet) in any room.

## Installation
### Environment Variables
The **#matrix** project has some environment variables that important to define.

- We are using Google to authorizations, you need create a credential [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in) and before define this variables:

		GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=${paste_your_client_id_here}
		GOOGLE_SECRET={paste_your_secret_here}
		GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:8080/auth/google/callback

- You can change the secret and maximum age from session:

		COOKIE_SESSION_SECRET=matrix-session
		COOKIE_SESSION_MAX_AGE=2592000000

- You can define a white List of trusted email domains can enter in the **#matrix**

		WHITELIST_DOMAINS=["@domain1.com","@domain2.com"]

- If you are running with ssl It's important to configure SSL, to define this:

		ENFORCE_SSL=true

- The **#matrix** needs to know, where it get rooms definitions:

		ROOMS_SOURCE=ENVIRONMENT

- There is a config that define the rooms of The **#matrix**, If you want to customize your rooms or add and a new room, you have to configure a `ROOMS_SOURCE=ENVIRONMENT` and config `ROOMS_DATA` like the example:


		ROOMS_DATA=[
		   {
		      "id":"${UUID}",
		      "name":"Lounge",
		      "disableMeeting":true
		   },
		   {
		      "id":"${UUID}",
		      "name":"WAR ROOM CDP"
		   },
		   {
		      "id":"${UUID}",
		      "name":"Data Services",
			  "externalMeetUrl": "https://external-url-room/key-room"
		   }
		 ]


#### External Meet
The embeded meet is provided by [meet.jit.si](https://meet.jit.si) service, but you can change that in any room, using serices like [Meet](https://meet.google.com/) or [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). For that, you just need provide the parameter `externalMeetUrl` in your room config:

		ROOMS_DATA=[
		   {
		      "id":"${UUID}",
		      "name":"Meeting External",
		      "externalMeetUrl": "https://external-url-room/key-room"
		   }
		 ]
### Authentication

The login is so simple. You only need to configure the Google API credentials following [this step by step](/docs/GOOGLE-CREDENTIAL-STEP-BY-STEP.md) .

|                                 Login                                 |                                   Login in Dark Mode                                    |

### Docker Compose

If you want run the **#matrix**, you need [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and follow steps:

1. Clone this repository `git clone git@github.com:ResultadosDigitais/matrix.git`

2. We are using Google to authorizations, you need create a credential [here](/docs/GOOGLE-CREDENTIAL-STEP-BY-STEP.md) you can follow step by step

3. duplicate file `variables.example.env` and rename to `variables.env`, after that set your environment variables;

4. Run application with docker compose:

		$ docker-compose up

5. Open your browser and access: 

		http://localhost:8080/

6. When you finish, you can run:

		$ docker-compose down

### On GCP 

If you prefer, you can run **#matrix** on GCP:

<a href="https://deploy.cloud.run?git_repo=https://github.com/sistema-blox/matrix&revision=gcp-deploy-button">
<img alt="Run on Google Cloud" src="https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg" style="max-width:200px"  />
</a>

### On Heroku

If you prefer, you can run **#matrix** in Heroku: 

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/sistema-blox/matrix)

### Production concerns

If you will run in production we strongly recommend you close your environment using an internal VPN. In this solution everybody with the link and a valid google credential can enter your virtual office. Because this is important for you to maintain your environment closed. Or you can define a variable `WHITELIST_DOMAINS` to limit only authorized users to enter in the **#matrix**. You have to choose a strong key to the `COOKIE_SESSION_SECRET` and have to put in `GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL` your production domain.
